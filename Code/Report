The travelling salesman problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem. The research on the exact algorithm for travelling salesman problem is significant not only because the research has sufficient practical significance. Until now, researchers have not found a polynomial time algorithm for the travelling salesman problem. Among the existing algorithms, the brute force algorithm can solve the problem in time O(n2Â·2n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph. 
The Algorithm used will use concepts of recursion to find the next path from one to point to another. It will also store all the distances of the subpaths. This will be beneficial when the program comes across the same path later on the program and can retrieve previous data that will save time instead of another run through the program. The result is expected to consume a large amount of memory but will have a more efficient time complexity in comparison to other factorial methods of O(n!), which can grow infinitely large.
